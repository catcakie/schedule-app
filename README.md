### My Personal Schedule App

As my responsibilities grew, I needed better tools to manage everything. Most of all, my time. But everything else is also fantastic.

#### What I personally use this for

Keeping track of:

- Skincare progress (with pics)
- Money spent
- My wish list
- My clothes
- Pet health
- Deadlines

#### Features

- Live Search
- Spreadsheet that saves to Google Sheets
  - Also saves the title, sheet data, & link into a record in the program
- Discord Bot functionality:
  - Displays current activity as the bot's status
  - Auto-backups on every save
  - Item notifier
- A simple textbox (sometimes you need it)
